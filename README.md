# DeepaMehta User Profiles Plugin

This plugin introduces a model to realize user profiles with a DeepaMehta "User Account". It adds "Display Name" and "Info" (HTML) to each DeepaMehta "User Account". If an "E-Mail"-Adress is not already part of a "User Account" type definition (mode), this plugin will do so in Migration1.
