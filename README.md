# DeepaMehta 4 eduZEN Profile Plugin

This plugin introduces a model to realize user profiles with a DeepaMehta "User Account". 

It adds a "Display Name" and "Info" (HTML) topic to the DeepaMehta "User Account" type definition.

If an "E-Mail"-Adress is not already part of that, this plugin will introduce this in Migration1.
